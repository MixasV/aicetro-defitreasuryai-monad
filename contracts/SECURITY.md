# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Aicetro smart contracts, please report it responsibly.

**Contact Methods:**
- **GitHub Issues:** For non-critical issues
- **Private Disclosure:** For critical vulnerabilities, please contact via GitHub private vulnerability reporting

**Please Include:**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information for follow-up

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- ✅ Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had time to address it
- ✅ Allow us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue (90 days)
- ✅ Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond proof-of-concept
- ✅ Do not access, modify, or delete data that doesn't belong to you

---

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline:** Varies by severity (critical: 7-14 days, high: 14-30 days, medium: 30-60 days)
- **Public Disclosure:** After fix is deployed and verified

---

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate responsible disclosure and will:
- Acknowledge security researchers in our documentation
- Provide attribution for significant findings
- Consider financial rewards for critical vulnerabilities on a case-by-case basis

---

## Audit Status

### ⚠️ Current Status: NOT AUDITED

**These contracts have NOT undergone a professional security audit.**

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ Monad Testnet: Active (for hackathon demonstration)
- ❌ Mainnet: Not deployed
- ❌ Production: Not recommended

**⚠️ DO NOT USE WITH REAL FUNDS**

A comprehensive security audit by a reputable firm (OpenZeppelin, Trail of Bits, Consensys Diligence, etc.) is **required** before any mainnet deployment.

## Known Limitations

### Testnet Deployment

**Current State:**
- Deployed on Monad Testnet (Chain ID: 2814)
- Test funds only
- May contain bugs or vulnerabilities
- Not production-ready

**Known Issues:**
- [ ] No formal audit completed
- [ ] Gas optimization not fully optimized
- [ ] Edge cases may not be fully tested
- [ ] Oracle integration not implemented (uses static prices for demo)

---

## Security Best Practices (For Users)

If you choose to interact with these contracts (testnet only):

1. **Never use production/mainnet wallets**
   - Use testnet-only wallets
   - Never send real funds

2. **Test small amounts first**
   - Start with minimal delegations
   - Verify behavior before increasing limits

3. **Monitor your delegation**
   - Check spending regularly
   - Use emergency stop if suspicious

4. **Revoke when not needed**
   - Don't leave delegations active indefinitely
   - Revoke permissions when done testing

5. **Review transactions**
   - Always verify transaction details in MetaMask
   - Check recipient addresses
   - Verify amounts before signing

---

## Security Features (Implemented)

### ✅ Trustless Architecture
- No admin keys or backdoors
- User retains full control
- All limits enforced on-chain

### ✅ Emergency Controls
- Instant emergency stop by user
- Immediate delegation revocation
- No timelock delays

### ✅ Spending Limits
- Daily limit enforcement
- Automatic 24-hour reset
- Spent amount tracking

### ✅ Protocol Restrictions
- Whitelist-based protocol access
- User-controlled whitelist
- Cannot interact with non-whitelisted protocols

### ✅ Time Expiration
- Delegations auto-expire
- Cannot execute after expiration
- User sets expiration time

---

## Planned Security Improvements

### Before Mainnet:

1. **Professional Security Audit**
   - Comprehensive smart contract audit
   - Economic security review
   - Game theory analysis

2. **Formal Verification**
   - Critical functions formally verified
   - Invariant checking
   - Symbolic execution

3. **Extended Testing**
   - Fuzzing tests
   - Stress testing
   - Edge case coverage

4. **Oracle Integration**
   - Chainlink or similar price feeds
   - Replace static pricing
   - Add staleness checks

5. **Gas Optimization**
   - Optimize storage patterns
   - Reduce deployment costs
   - Minimize execution costs

6. **Emergency Multisig** (Optional)
   - Community-controlled emergency pause
   - Time-locked upgrades
   - Only for critical vulnerabilities

---

## Incident Response Plan

In case of a security incident:

### Phase 1: Detection (0-1 hour)
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Automated alerts for unusual patterns
- Community reports via GitHub

### Phase 2: Assessment (1-4 hours)
- Verify incident severity
- Identify affected users
- Determine scope of impact

### Phase 3: Response (4-24 hours)
- Emergency stop if needed
- Notify affected users
- Coordinate with exchanges (if mainnet)

### Phase 4: Resolution (24-72 hours)
- Deploy fix if possible
- Compensate affected users (if applicable)
- Post-mortem analysis

### Phase 5: Disclosure (72+ hours)
- Public disclosure after fix
- Update documentation
- Implement additional safeguards
